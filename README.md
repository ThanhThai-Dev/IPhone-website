# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies to build a high-performance and maintainable web application:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript.
- **SWC**: A super-fast TypeScript / JavaScript compiler.

## Sentry Integration

To ensure the application is robust and to monitor for any runtime errors, we have integrated Sentry. Sentry helps in tracking and fixing errors in real-time, providing insights into the performance of the application.
